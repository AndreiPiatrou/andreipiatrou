## Disclaimer

This is just a personal opinion and experience and these thoughts do not event pretend to be worth to read! :-)

Also, I like all sorts of lists so please bear with me a little.

## What is a technical interview?

A technical interview is an act of communication in a group of people where every participant has her/his personal goals and expected results.

For a candidate these goals are:
- show and sell his/her skills, abilities, ambitions and potential to a company as expensive as possible
- understand what a certain company could offer for his/her skills and abilities
- understand the opportunity on how the candidate could bring the value and apply his/her ambitions against company realities and goals

For a company they are:
- understand candidate's hard/sort skills and his/her mindset
- understand how this level could be applied against the company needs
- sell the company to a candidate as the place where he/she could be valuable and could grow as a pro

By these points above every participant makes a decision on should he stick with this partner or not.

## The issue

By my *_personal_* experience every participant has a list of mistakes and misunderstandings on how he reaches his/her coals.

Usually a candidate:
- is not ready to tell a story about his/her professional experience
- has a pretty poor resume that does not explicitly describes his/her skills and ambitions
- does not have a list of requirements to a company in order to fail fast

In its turn a company:
- does not allow to tell a candidate his/her story
- has a list of certain technical questions that does not reveal a real technical level of a candidate and his/her mindset
- poses a technical interview as a fight between two warriors where one attacks and the other responds to that attacks

## How I try to fix these issues as a technical expert

### Pose a technical interview as a story of a candidate

Usually a technical expert has its own set of questions to ask for a candidate and this is the first and main mistake. When you as a technical expert starts with such list of questions You reveal the area that is shown on the following picture:

// TODO: add a picture

But the overall goal is to discover the following area:

// TODO: add a picture

So the question here is: _*how can You get to that area?*_

The answer is: _*obviously, make a candidate to guide You there!*_

Usually, the first question I ask is something like the following: 

_*Please, tell me the most interesting story from your technical experience that reveals You as a professional engineer. It could be a great success or failure. It could be a bug that has been introduced ages ago and nobody except You could fix it. Any challenge that worth to tell your family near the fireplace.*_

Your first thought might be:

_It sounds a bit broad and does not bring much value on his/her technical stack and knowledge!_

I should answer:

_*No. When a candidate indeed has something to say - he or she will do this and then step by step You as a tech expert will dive to that secret area and by using such signs as clarifying questions will get deeper and deeper.*_

### Questions to do/don't ask

The following questions usually do not help You:
- theoretical questions that require certain definition as an answer: having an understanding of something is much more valuable then knowing of a certain definition 
- tricky questions regarding programming language or platform: in case You are interested in tricky things and aspects of language or platform, You expect that a candidate will write tricky code as well which is not the right expectation though
- do not ask questions that require `yes/no` answer: such kind of questions could be guessed and require further clarification

And the list that usually brings a valuable output is the following:
- solve regular coding tasks from the field, for example: `map/filter/reduce` tasks, basic DB schema with all kinds of relations and so on. It helps to understand that candidate has basic experience from real world in a couple of minutes. 
- ask questions that reveal a mindset and a way of thinking rather than on knowing certain language/framework API: such kind of knowledge is much more useful and applicable

### Other do and don't

- try to see the mindset but not a current set of knowledge because of knowledge is much easier to gain in comparison with mindset
- know the company You are working on or looking talents for
- know the resume, it shows that You are interested in a candidate and makes a conversation much more comfortable for both sides
- if there is an ability to take a walk during your conversation - just do it
- be a friend not a examiner, in this case overall communication will have a wright context and direction

## Conclusion

So the thoughts above are just personal opinion and are not pretend to be a truth but could help someone to make such activity as interview more efficient and productive for every side.
