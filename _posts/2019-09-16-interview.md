## Disclaimer

This is just a personal opinion and experience and these thoughts do not pretend to be even a efficient to read! :-)

Also, I like lists so please bear with me a little.

## What is a technical interview?

A technical interview on my mind is an act of communication between a group of people where every participant has her/his personal goals and expected results.

For a candidate they are:
- sell his/her skills, abilities, ambitions and potential to some company
- understand what a certain company could offer for his/her skills and abilities
- understand the opportunity on how the candidate could bring the value and apply his/her ambitions against company realities

For a company they are:
- understand current technical level of a candidate
- understand how this level could be applied against the company needs
- sell the company to a candidate as the place where he/she could be valuable and could grow as a pro

By these points above every side makes a decision on should it stick with this partner or not.

## The issue

By my personal experience every side has a list of mistakes and misunderstandings on how it follows its goals.

Usually a candidate:
- is not ready to tell a story about his/her technical experience
- has a pretty poor resume that does not explicitly describes his/her skills and ambitions
- does not have a list of questions to a company and indicators to compare companies between each other

In its turn a company:
- does not allow to tell a candidate's story
- has a list of certain technical questions that does not reveal a real technical level of a candidate
- positions a technical interview as a fight between two engineers

## How I try to fix these issues as a technical expert

### Pose a technical interview as a story of a candidate

Usually a technical expert has its own set of questions to ask candidate and this is the first and main mistake. When you as a technical expert starts with such list You reveal the area that is shown on the following picture:

<p align="center">

</p>

But the overall goal is to discover the following area:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/assets/images/knowledge-2.png" alt="/knowledge-2" width="500"/>
</p>

So the question is: _how can You get to that area?_

The answer is: _obviously, make a candidate to guide You there!_

Usually, the first question I ask something like the following: _please, tell me the most interesting story from your technical experience that shows You as a professional engineer. It could be a great success or failure. It could be a bug that has been introduced ages ago and nobody except You could fix it. Any challenge that worth to tell your family near the fireplace._

Your first thought might be: _it sounds a bit broad and does not bring much value on his/her technical stack and knowledge!_

I should answer: yes and no. When a candidate indeed has something to say - he or she will do this and then sentence by sentence You as a tech expert will go to that secret area and by using such signs as clarifying questions will dive deeper and deeper.
