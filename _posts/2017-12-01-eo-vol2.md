## Elegant Objects (vol 2) review
I found out about Yegor by "Рабор Полетов" podcast [episode 105][link_razbor_poletov_105]. His ideas about OOP and management seemed very interesting and exciting to me also Yegor was promoting his book in that podcast so I decided to get one and come closer to his ideas.
After reading of EO I have a couple of pros and cons of this book to share with you.

Pros:
1. It is interesting and exciting indeed. The author reveals us real-world problems and questions that every developer, which wants to write OOP code, time by time asks himself.
2. It shows a different way of thinking about OOP overall that definitely is useful for every developer to extend his or her horizons of thinking.
3. This book is very easy to read and code examples are as simple as possible so you do not have to know `Ruby` or `C++` to read this book and understand what author wants to say.
4. EO is a good book to diversify your **classic** OOP library with some another vision and ideas.

Cons:
1. Some Yegor's suggestions are not applicable in real world and benefits are not so noticeable to rewrite all existing code and frameworks by his ideas.
2. Some ideas, like `containers` and `getters`, seem to me as fictional problems and were described just to make some hype and discussions.

As a result of this short review, I want to say that EO has a right to take a place in your developer library and can show another way of OOP.exciting to me also Yegor was promoting his book in that podcast so I desided to get one and come closer to his ideas.
